# Live Schedule Widget for GitHub Pages

It's quite common that you will need to make changes to your run of show on the fly, but it can be difficult to ensure it's correct everywhere!

We've built a quick template that works with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, making it super easy to take a Google Calendar and display it on your website. Best bit is it updates whenever the page is updated and it's free!

## Get Started

Setting up a Google Calendar

1. Create a new calendar on a Google or G Suite account. 
2. Set the calendar to public and to display event information.
3. Add other users to edit the calendar
4. Get the Calendar ID at the bottom of the calendar settings page and add it to `calendar.js`
